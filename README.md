<img src= "./Images/PacMan1.png" width = '300' />

This project creates a pacman that is able to move aross the screen and is "animated." 
Once it reaches the end of the screen, it will turn around and go in the other direction.

How to run: Download the zip file for this repository (link: https://github.com/RealGarrettF/Pacman). Open the file and select the Pacman.html file and drag it onto your browser. Have fun!

Future Improvements: 

                     - Give the pacman the ability to move in all four directions

                     - Give the pacman the ability follow your cursor
                     
                     - Give the pacman the ability change colors dependent on its direction of movement
